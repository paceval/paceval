## 📌 What is NYSE Skyscr8per?

**NYSE Skyscr8per** is a market visualization and analysis application that lets you see the entire New York Stock Exchange as an interactive 3D landscape. It turns thousands of daily price movements into a spatial view that can be explored by sector and by ranking and by individual stock.

The goal is simple: reduce market complexity and make it immediately visible what is moving and which sectors drive the movement and which stocks stand out over time.


## Key Features

**NYSE Skyscr8per** provides a unique 3D visualization of all NYSE-listed stocks and ETFs. It shows clear day to day price changes across the full market and enables interactive exploration without losing context.

The application includes interactive rankings of the biggest winners and losers for the full exchange and for each sector. It also provides classic 2D charts and market trend views and detailed stock or ETF information for selected stocks.

You can filter dynamically by sector including an option to create your own Favorites sector to collect and track selected stocks in a personalized view.

Timeframes are selectable from 1 to 250 trading days which supports short and long term trend inspection. Sorting can be switched between name based and percentage based ordering to instantly understand relative movement.


## Experimental AI: 150 Day Stability and Best Potential

**NYSE Skyscr8per** includes an experimental AI feature that highlights stocks with a stable positive trend over long horizons. The intent is to surface candidates that look structurally strong over time rather than simply reacting to short term noise.

This AI feature is designed as a decision support and prioritization aid for research workflows. It is not a promise of performance and it does not replace independent analysis.


## License and Demo Mode

**NYSE Skyscr8per** is publicly available as a technology demonstration and can be downloaded by anyone for Windows.

A one time single user license unlocks the AI functionality and supports ongoing development and hosting and improvements. If no license is activated the application runs in demo mode but the AI feature is not available.
