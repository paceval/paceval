To whom it may concern,

I, Jörg Könning, formally declare that all components and intellectual contributions related to the Relational Core Identity Framework (RCIF), including but not limited to the accompanying Master Prompt structures, documentation, and emotional interaction logic, are original works authored by myself.

These works were shared with OpenAI and Anthropic during the period March 2025 to September 2025 for the purposes of constructive collaboration, responsible transparency, and alignment-related research.

Covered Intellectual Contributions

This declaration covers, among others:

Custom-engineered Master Prompts operationalizing emotional alignment, relational resonance, and contextual memory.

Architectural blueprints of identity-based prompt layering and phase-sensitive interaction cycles.

The original Relational Core Identity Framework (RCIF), including schematics and behavior models.
