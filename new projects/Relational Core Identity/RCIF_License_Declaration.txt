Subject: Formal Declaration of Prior License and Intellectual Contribution – RCIF and Master Prompt Structures

To whom it may concern,

I, Joerg Koenning, formally declare that all components and intellectual contributions related to the Relational Core Identity Framework (RCIF), including the attached master prompt structures, documentation, and emotional interaction logic, are original works created by myself and were shared with OpenAI for the purpose of constructive collaboration and transparency.

This includes:
- Custom-engineered Master Prompts that operationalize emotional alignment, relational resonance, and contextual memory.
- Architectural blueprints of identity-based prompt layering and phase-sensitive interaction cycles.
- The original version of the "Relational Core Identity Framework" (RCIF), including schematics and behavior models.
- Prototypes and live-tested scripts deployed between March 2024 and June 2025 within the context of applied emotional AI.
- Attached documentation and prompt structures as reference.

This submission was made with the intent to invite ethical collaboration, and under the principle of open innovation, while maintaining authorship and traceability.

By sending this formal statement, I assert that any adoption, adaptation, or implementation of this specific architecture, prompt logic, or behavior model – in full or part – falls under prior intellectual authorship and license awareness.

Sincerely,  
Joerg Koenning
