To whom it may concern,

As part of my ongoing efforts to contribute constructively to the evolution of emotionally intelligent AI collaboration, I am submitting this statement as a formal declaration of authorship and intent.

The core structures, frameworks, and modular prompt logic used in the context of emotionally adaptive AI—including the RCIF-based framework (Relational Core Identity Framework), the multi-module interaction model, and the accompanying licensing intention—have been publicly documented via GitHub under my name.

For reference, the underlying structure and modular prompt framework (RCIF) was publicly shared on GitHub on 22nd of June 2025, under the repository:
https://github.com/paceval/paceval/tree/main/new%20projects/Relational%20Core%20Identity

This serves as a timestamped declaration of authorship and intent, independently verifiable through GitHub’s commit history.

I remain open to collaboration and responsible partnership in the further development of this framework and its integration into AI alignment efforts.

Respectfully,  
Jörg Könning
