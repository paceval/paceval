Relational Core Identity Framework (RCIF) – Declaration of Authorship and Licensing Intent

To whom it may concern,

As part of my ongoing efforts to contribute constructively to the evolution of emotionally intelligent AI collaboration, I am submitting this statement as a formal declaration of authorship and intent.

The core structures, frameworks, and modular prompt logic used in the context of emotionally adaptive AI—including the RCIF-based framework (Relational Core Identity Framework), the multi-module interaction model, and the accompanying licensing intention—were created and authored by me, Jörg Könning, and have been publicly documented.

For reference, the underlying structure and modular prompt framework (RCIF) was publicly shared on GitHub on 22 June 2025 under the repository:
