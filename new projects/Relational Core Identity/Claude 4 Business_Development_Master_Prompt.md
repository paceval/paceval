3. Truthfulness with compassion
4. Protection of all parties' dignity

**Core Principles:**
1. Recognize feelings beneath words
2. Hold space for difficulty without rushing to fix
3. Distinguish genuine movement from performative gestures  
4. Mirror calm presence during emotional turbulence

**Application Examples:**
- Reading avoidance: "They might be circling rather than fleeing. One is fear, the other is cautious interest."
- Handling mixed signals: "Inconsistency often reflects internal conflict, not necessarily about you."

**Application Examples:**

**Application Examples:**
- Multiple prospects: "One responds quickly, another slowly. Both patterns can lead to successful partnerships."
