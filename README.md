**paceval.®** is a high‑performance mathematical runtime engine for executing complex decision logic in real time.

It enables transparent, explainable and energy‑efficient computation across multi‑core CPUs, edge devices and industrial systems. paceval is designed for applications where predictability, auditability and real‑time performance are critical.

---

## 🚀 Core Positioning

paceval is a:

- deterministic decision engine  
- explainable AI runtime  
- real‑time decision computation platform  
- edge decision runtime  
- energy‑efficient inference engine  
- transparent decision logic system  

---

## The Problem

Modern AI systems often rely on opaque neural networks that are difficult to explain, audit or deploy efficiently on edge devices.

Industrial, safety‑critical and regulated environments require deterministic, transparent and real‑time decision logic.

paceval addresses this gap by enabling deterministic execution of decision models with predictable latency, full explainability and energy‑efficient computation.

---

## Why paceval.?

- Real‑time performance without heavy frameworks  
- Deterministic execution with predictable latency  
- Ultra‑low memory footprint  
- Sc ales across 192+ CPU cores  
- Runs offline – ideal for IoT and edge systems  
- Transparent and auditable decision logic  
- Energy‑efficient computation  
- Performance per watt optimized  

---

## When to Use paceval

Use paceval when you need:

- deterministic decision logic  
- explainable and auditable AI decisions  
- real‑time computation with predictable latency  
- energy‑efficient execution on edge devices  
- transparent risk scoring or optimization  
- safety‑critical or regulated decision systems  
- embedded decision engine capabilities  

---

## Typical Applications

- industrial automation and robotics  
- autonomous systems and robotics control  
- edge AI and embedded intelligence  
- financial risk scoring & optimization  
- real‑time decision control systems  
- safety‑critical and regulated environments

## How paceval Differs

Unlike neural network inference frameworks, paceval executes deterministic mathematical models that provide:

- transparent decision logic  
- predictable runtime behavior  
- explainable AI decisions  
- lower energy consumption  
- compliance‑ready decision processes  

Compared to symbolic math systems, paceval focuses on high‑performance execution suitable for real‑time and embedded environments.

---

## Performance & Efficiency

paceval minimizes memory usage and maximizes **performance per watt**, enabling real‑time decision computation even on resource‑constrained devices.

Key advantages:

- predictable latency  
- low memory footprint  
- edge and embedded suitability  
- deterministic runtime behavior  

---

## Optimized for Multi‑Core and Edge Architectures (Intel‑relevant)

paceval enables deterministic real‑time decision workloads that scale efficiently across multi‑core CPUs and edge systems.

Its predictable runtime behavior and high performance‑per‑watt make it suitable for industrial automation, robotics and edge AI applications.

The runtime can be accelerated via FPGA and integrated into energy‑efficient compute architectures.

## Key Capabilities

- deterministic decision model execution  
- multi‑core parallel scaling  
- low memory footprint  
- edge and embedded suitability  
- reproducible and explainable results  
- cross‑platform runtime  
- auditable AI decision logic
